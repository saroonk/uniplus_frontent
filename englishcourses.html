                    <h3 class="content-heading">What you will Study</h3>

                    <p>Details of our different English Language Programmes can be found on the individual courses pages.  However, whichever course you decide meets your needs you can be assured of the same high standard of teaching.</p>

                    <p>Group classes are kept small so that teachers can focus more easily on the specific needs of individual students. It is also possible to combine group lessons with one-to-one sessions or simply take all one-to-one lessons if you prefer.</p>
                    <p>Before you start your course you will be assessed and discuss your own individual study plan with one of our teachers. As your course continues, regular assessments will show the progress you are making and highlight any weaknesses which need to be worked on.</p>
