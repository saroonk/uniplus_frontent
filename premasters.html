                    <h3 class="content-heading">Who Needs an IFG Pre-masters</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        Pre-Masters programmes are specifically designed for international students. who do not meet standard entry requirements for postgraduate study in an English-speaking country.
                    </p>

                    <p>
They are designed to give students the academic skills that they need for postgraduate-level study, while improving their English to the required level.  They often, as in the case of our Pre-Masters in Business Management, offer progression to specific taught masters courses at universities in English-speaking countries.

                    </p>

                    <p>
Universities in the UK generally require the equivalent of at least a 2:2 degree (50 – 59%)and usually a 2:1 (60-69%) undergraduate degree for entry to a taught masters.  So even if you have the required English level you may still require a Pre-Masters.
                    </p>


                    <h3 class="content-heading">The IFG Pre-Masters Programme offer</h3>

                    <p>
<strong>IFG offers two focused pre-masters and a shorter more general programme:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Pre-Masters in Business Management (6-months)</p>
                    <p>Pre-Masters in Law (6-months)</p>
                    <p>Pre-sessional for Postgraduate Studies(3-months)</p>





                    <h3 class="content-heading">The difference between undergraduate and postgraduate study</h3>
<p>UK taught masters require a higher level of English than undergraduate degrees and are generally one academic year in length rather than three.  There are also significant academic differences.</p>
                    <p>Masters degrees involve a much more in-depth study of a chosen field. This requires a far greater depth of analysis and research and so means that postgraduate students are expected to undertake more independent study than at undergraduate level.</p>
<p>Students should come away from a postgraduate course with a strong understanding and the specialist knowledge to be considered an expert or specialist in that field.  A pre-masters will prepare you for the different level of study and academic skills required.</p>






                    <h3 class="content-heading">What you will Study</h3>
                    <p>The specific content of each of our Pre-Masters in Business Management and Pre-Masters in Law can be found on the relevant pages.  As well as key subject modules you will also learn the research, communication and analytical skills that you will require at university.</p>





                    <h3 class="content-heading">Progression to masters study in the UK</h3>
                    <p>
    Our Pre-Masters in Business Management leads to a range of taught masters at the University of Derby Business School and Aston University.
</p>

<p>
    Our Pre-Masters in Law programme is designed for graduates wanting to progress onto an LLM or other law-related master’s degree in the UK and includes one-to-one assistance in choosing and applying to your chosen course.
</p>

<p>
    The IFG Pre-sessional for Postgraduate Studies is a more general programme for students who meet the academic subject requirements of their chosen course but need to focus on their research and academic skills.
